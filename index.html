			<p id="id_lnd">At Altimetrik, we invest extensively in learning and development programs for the benefit of our employees. We prudently organize events that help upgrade technology and soft skills that eventually nurture personal growth. This would ensure that personal growth of employees is not stalled.  </p>
			<p id="id_wlb">Our work principles have been designed to benefit employees. We ensure our people maintain unspoiled work-life balance.  The need to ruin personal life to execute professional commitments seldom arises.  </p>
			<p id="id_ra">To ensure no 'Jack' from our organization becomes 'Dull', we plan leisure activities we expose them to several leisure activities. We tend to pamper them and they return back to office with a fresh thinking mind. Often, our entire office becomes a fun place to be in. We are open to activities from cycling to beekeeping, from frisbee to foxtrot.</p>
			<p id="id_dsnl">At Altimetrik, we have the access to an inimitable design studio and lab. The set up in our design studio and lab offers an environment for free thinking and encourages uninterrupted innovation. Our engineers and designers can utilize and leverage the arrangement to come up with unique ideas. 
                     The philosophy behind creation of the design studio and lab was free flow and exchange of ideas and research across hierarchies and departments.  Our engineers and designers get a platform to perform fresh experiments and innovation. 
                     Our people get uninterrupted access to information and latest technologies. 
                     We offer space, budget and project management support to ensure good ideas get executed rapidly. Sales engineers often have to kill their desire of creating compelling software demos due to presence of slow machines, intricate set-up and inadequate IT support. To combat the issue and make available facilities that foster creative thinking and innovation we have designed and installed the unique design lab. This enhances the process of transforming set of trial products into saleable ideas and commodities. Thus, making Altimetrik capable of ideating, creating, executing and launching fresh products more often in the market. We also encourage the idea of optimizing the existing solutions which becomes possible due to the adequate amenities present in our lab.
			</p>
			<p id="id_rdt">At Altimetrik, we believe in the infusion of Art, Technology and Engineering. We believe the future of the Software industry is going to be more of assembling of codes rather than development of codes.  We would make available certain sets of ready-to-be-used codes that could be put together rapidly, without much hassle. The ready-to-be-used codes would be tried and tested to perfection and one would not require spending useless time testing it every time.  The codes could be Engineered to work under varied circumstances, contexts and scale. 
                     We strongly believe that the world of software development desperately requires infusion of art. We at Altimetrik, involve creativity and art in every project we work on. We tend to lean towards convergence of Art, Technology and Engineering.
